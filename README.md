## Why Murmeln?

Love the idea of voice dictation apps but want to:
- **Use your own API keys** instead of paying subscription fees?
- **Choose your provider** — OpenAI, Groq, Gemini, or self-hosted?
- **Keep it simple** — no account, no cloud sync, just dictation?

Murmeln is for you. It's the **BYOAPI** (Bring Your Own API) dictation tool.

## Permissions

Murmeln needs three permissions to work:

| Permission | Why | How to Grant |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| **Microphone** | Record your voice | Prompt on first use |
| **Accessibility** | Global Fn key hotkey | System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility |
| **Automation** | Auto-paste text | Prompt on first use |

---

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>Fn key not working</strong></summary>

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**
2. Find Murmeln and toggle it **off** then **on**
3. Restart Murmeln
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Text not pasting</strong></summary>

1. Allow Murmeln to control System Events when prompted
2. Make sure the target app has an active text field
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Microphone permission keeps asking</strong></summary>

This happens with unsigned builds. For persistent permission, the app needs code signing with a Developer ID.
</details>
